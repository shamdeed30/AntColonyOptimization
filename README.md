## Comparison of 3 three variants with varied number ants ant and number of cities:
Test done in the ACO_comparison.ipynb file. Refer to that for all the plots
* Set high and low number of ant; low = 5, high = 50
* Set high anf low number of city; low = 20, high = 80

# Rank-Based Ant System (ASrank)
In the Rank-based Ant System, all solutions generated by the ants are ranked according to a chosen criterion. Typically, the ranking is based on the quality of the solution, such as its length or cost. In some cases, where all paths have the same length, other factors can be considered, such as the number of constraints violated.

# Elitist Ant System
This system optimize the basic algorithm by strengthen current solution each iteration. In each iteration, the best solution will generate some pheromone whether there is an ant across.

# Max-Min Ant System (MMAS)
In the Max-Min system, there is a lower and upper limit (i.e lower=0.2, upper=2) of pheromone deposit in each path. This ensures that the algorithm doesn’t stagnate to a suboptimal solution. For each iteration, the algorithm limits the pheromone deposit in this ranges while updating the pheromone matrix. This gives the ant swarm more chances for exploration, hence, increasing the possibility of finding the best path
